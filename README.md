# Java RGP Heroes

This is my solution for the first Java backend assignment of the Noroff bootcamp! It is a Maven application written in Java. 
I have completed this assignment on my own.

## Requirements

a) Various hero classes having attributes which increase at different rates as the character gains levels.

b) Equipment, such as armor and weapons, that characters can equip. The equipped items will alter the power of 
the hero, causing it to deal more damage and be able to survive longer. Certain heroes can equip certain item 
types.

c) Custom exceptions. There are two custom exceptions you are required to write, as detailed in Appendix B.

d) Testing of the main functionality.
